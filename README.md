### 👋 About Me

I'm a software engineer with a focus on AI, machine learning, and platform integrity. I enjoy building systems that are technically solid, user-conscious, and socially meaningful.

I’m particularly interested in:
- Applied ML & NLP  
- Trust, safety, and content authenticity  
- Tools that make advanced tech more accessible  

I care about shipping clean, ethical, and scalable products.
